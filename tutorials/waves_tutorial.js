<!-- note to maintainers:

This document serves as both the README for the project and as the source
code for the heart of the simulation. This is done since certain aspects of the
documentation of the project can only be adequately precise by including source
code inline; rather than duplicate the code across the documentation page and
the source document, they are kept together in one place. As such, the prose
block at the beginning and the code block at the end are carefully enclosed in
interlocking delimiters so that javascript ignores the README text and the
README pretty-prints the javascript source. Take care not to disturb these
block delimeters.

Futhermore, take care to limit the scope of the source code in this document
to only that which is essential for understanding the core of the simulation.

# The Digital Audio Workbench

https://idmil.gitlab.io/course-materials/mumt203/interactive-demos 

## Introduction

The purpose of the digital audio workbench is to illustrate key concepts in
digital audio theory with interactive visualizations of each stage of the
analog-to-digial conversion (ADC) and digital-to-analog conversion (DAC)
processes.  These visualizations are inspired by demonstrations using
oscilloscopes and spectrum analyzers to compare the analog signal input into
the ADC process with the analog signal output by the DAC process, e.g.
https://youtu.be/cIQ9IXSUzuM

By experimenting with the settings of the simulation, numerous key concepts in
digital signal theory can be nicely illustrated, such as aliasing, quantization
error, critical sampling, under and oversampling, and many others.  The
interactive interface allows the simulation to be explored freely; users can
examine the signals both visually through numerous graphs, or by listening to
the test signals directly.

## Implementation

Since our demonstration takes place purely in the digital domain, we
unfortunately cannot use real continuous time analog inputs and outputs.
Instead, we simulate the ADC-DAC processes in the discrete time domain.  The
analog input and output are represented as discrete time signals with a high
sampling rate; at the time of writing, the maximum sampling rate supported
by WebAudio is 96 kHz. 

The ADC process consists of several steps, including antialiasing, sampling,
and quantization. All of these are simulated in our model: antialiasing is
achieved with a windowed sinc FIR lowpass filter of order specified by the
user; sampling is approximated by downsampling the input signal by an
integer factor; and quantization is achieved by multiplying the sampled
signal (which ranges from -1.0 to 1.0) by the maximum integer value possible
given the requested bit depth (e.g. 255 for a bit depth of 8 bits), and then
rounding every sample to the nearest integer.  The DAC process is simulated
in turn by zero stuffing and lowpass filtering the sampled and quantized
output of the ADC simultion.  

In summary, the continuous time input is simulated by a 96 kHz discrete time
signal, the sampled output of the ADC process is simulated by a downsampled
and quantized signal, and the continuous time reconstruction output by the
DAC is simulated by upsampling the "sampled" signal back to 96 kHz.  In our
tests we have found this model to be reasonable; many key concepts, such as
critical sampling, aliasing, and quantization noise are well represented in
our simulation.

For more details, the reader is encouraged to peruse the rest of the source
code in this document.  Many comments have been included to aid readers who
are unfamiliar with javascript.  Any questions you may have about the
implementation of the simulation can only be definitively answered by
understanding the source code, but please feel free to contact the project
maintainers if you have any questions.
