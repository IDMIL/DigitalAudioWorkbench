        The Digital Audio Workbench aims to provide an accessible interactive
        platform for intuitively exploring key concepts in digital audio.  
        <br><br>

        Both <i>Time-</i> and <i>Frequency-domain</i> views of signals are presented, 
        as well as audio rendering of parameter manipulation.

        <br><br>
        Numerous modular graphs are available, which can aid in
        teaching and studying issues such as aliasing, quantization,
        the effect of dithering, and more. 
    </p>

         Note that so far we have only tested the project on recent Chromium-based browsers.  Furthermore, the display is
        not yet adequately responsive for mobile devices and other small screens.
